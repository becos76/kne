Sample configs and a pb.txt file for launching an XRd topology using Google's delightful KNE tool: https://github.com/google/kne

Repo also includes a modified cisco.go file to accommodate XRd ENV and setup script changes which occurred between 7.6.x and 7.7.x releases.
If using XRd 7.7.x or later replace this file: https://github.com/google/kne/blob/main/topo/node/cisco/cisco.go with the cisco.go file in this repo
